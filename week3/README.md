# Week 3 homework assignments

<p>This week's assignment was to create a a guessing game and or Hangman, using JavaScript. The way the guessing game works is the 'computer' picks a random letter in the alphabet and then the user get a certain number of guesses to get it right. The Hangman game is similar, only instead of a letter it's a random word from the Array of words it can choose.</p>

## Challenges
* I was new to JavaScript so getting used to the logic of the language was difficult at the beginning.
* Figuring out how to display the word anonymously but with the correct number of blank spaces for the given word.
* Replacing the blank space with the correct letter guessed, while keeping the rest of the unguessed places blank.
