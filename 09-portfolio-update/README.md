# WEEK NINE HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS

<p>This week's assignment was to recreate our portfolios from the beginning of the class. We were required to include our Github, Linkedin and email this time.</p>

## CHALLENGES
* One really big challenge for me was designing it. I am admittedly not good at designing and coming up with creative designs.
