# WEEK FOUR HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS

<p>This week's assignment was to create a counting game using JavaScript and JQuery. Upon the initial load or when the user wins or losses and the game resets, each crystal in the selection should have a random number ranging from 1 to 12. The goal is for the user to match their score with the number the 'computer' generates (19-120). When the user selects a crystal, its value is added to the users' total score. The value of each crystal is hidden from the user so they must use their own memory and math skills to win. If the user's total score goes above the target score they needed to match, then a message will display that tells the user that they lost and the game will restart.</p>

## CHALLENGES
* Getting started with using JQuery took some getting used to, but was pretty intuitive once you get used to how it works.
* Understanding the logic that goes into the function that passes a different random value to each crystal was difficult at first.
* Ran into some issues regarding redundant code and functions.
