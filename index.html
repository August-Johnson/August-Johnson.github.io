          My name is August but I mostly go by Gus with friends. I am originally from
          South Korea and was adopted as a baby and lived in Minnesota ever since. I mainly 
          play video games in my spare time and listen to music. I enjoy learning about history, 
          law and keeping up with politics. My favorite animals are cats. I have a dog named Daisy 
          and a cat named Magic.
