    <p>My name is August but I mostly go by Gus with friends. I am originally from
       South Korea and was adopted as a baby and lived in Minnesota ever since. I mainly 
       play video games in my spare time. My favorite animals are cats. I was interested 
       in cooking and was planning on enrolling in Le Cordon Bleu until they shut donw the 
       Minnesota campus.</p>
