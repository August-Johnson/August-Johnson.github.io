# WEEK 11 HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT

<p>This week's assignment was to create a hangman game through the command line, using Node, npm inquirer and constructors. It would essentially function like a normal hangman game, except it's run through the command line with Node.</p>

## CHALLENGES

* Linking all of the js files together coherently.
* Making sure my code wasn't a mess or confusing.
* Using constructors as the primary method of creating and calling functions.
