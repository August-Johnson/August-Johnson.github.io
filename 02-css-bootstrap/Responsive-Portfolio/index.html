      <p>
        My name is August, but I mostly go by Gus. I was born in Inchon, South Korea, and was adopted as a baby and
        have lived in Minnesota ever since.

        I went to a French immersion school from kindergarten through sixth grade. That contributed to my interest in
        foreign cultures. I was even lucky enough to visit Paris and put my language skills into practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my spare time, I mainly play video games and listen to music. I enjoy learning about history and law and
        keeping up with politics. My favorite animals are cats. I have a dog named Daisy and a cat named Magic. I
        graduated from high school in 2016 and worked at Lunds & Byerlys for about a year.
      </p>

        Once I found out about coding and by extension this boot camp, it seemed like a good fit. Before I started my
        class, I was able to shadow the front end accessibility development team at U.S. Bank for an entire day. During
        that day I met some amazing people who taught me a lot about the important core fundamentals and how to ensure
        your code is accessible. I was able to absorb so much that day, and it fueled my desire to learn and succeed
        even more.
