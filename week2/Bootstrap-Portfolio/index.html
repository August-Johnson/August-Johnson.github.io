                    My name is August, but I mostly go by Gus. I was born in Inchon, South Korea, and was adopted as a
                    baby and have lived in Minnesota ever since.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I went to a French immersion school from kindergarten through sixth grade. That contributed to my
                    interest in foreign cultures. I was even lucky enough to visit Paris and put my language skills
                    into practice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my spare time, I mainly play video games and listen
                    to music. I enjoy learning about history and law and keeping up with politics. My favorite animals
                    are cats. I have a dog named Daisy and a cat named Magic. I graduated from high school in 2016 and
                    worked at Lunds & Byerlys for about a year.

                    Once I
                    found out about coding and by extension this boot camp, it seemed like a good fit.
                    Before I started my class, I was able to shadow the front end accessibility development team at
                    U.S. Bank for an entire day. During that day I met some amazing people who taught me a lot about
                    the important core fundamentals and how to ensure your code is accessible. I was able to absorb so
                    much that day, and it fueled my desire to learn and succeed even more.
