                <p>My name is August, but I mostly go by Gus. I was born in Inchon, South Korea, and was adopted as a
                    baby and have lived in Minnesota ever since. In my spare time, I mainly play video games and listen
                    to music. I enjoy learning about history and law and keeping up with politics. My favorite animals
                    are cats. I have a dog named Daisy and a cat named Magic.

                        <p>I graduated from high school in 2016 and worked at Lunds & Byerlys for about a year. I left
                            there on good terms to focus on finding a career path that would fit my personality. I
                            played around with the idea of trades such as carpentry and metal working but they didn't
                            seem right for me. Once I found out about coding and by extension this boot camp, it seemed
                            like a good fit.

                <p>Before I started my class, I was able to shadow the front end accessibility development team at U.S.
                    Bank for an entire day. During that day I met some amazing people who taught me a lot about the
                    important core fundamentals and how to ensure your code is accessible. I was able to absorb so much
                    that day, and it fueled my desire to learn and succeed even more.
