# Week 6 homework assignments

<p>This week's assignment was to use the GIPHY API along with JQuery, AJAX and JavaScript to create a sort of 'GIF search' page. The page would initially show an array of buttons with different labels on them depending of the theme (I went with animals), and when the user selects one, it would make a call to the API and display the top 10 search results based on which button was chosen. The user also has to option to see more results by selecting the 'More Results' button, which will show an additional 10 results. The GIFS are still upon initial load, but once the user clicks on the image, it will animate and loop like a normal GIF. They can also stop the GIF animation again by clicking it a second time.</p>

## Challenges
* Getting used to AJAX calls and how they work and store data.
* Saving the value of a JavaScript object and passing it into the AJAX call.
* Having the GIFs load as a still image by default and animate upon click.
