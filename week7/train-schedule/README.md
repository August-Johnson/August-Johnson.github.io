# WEEK SEVEN HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS

<p>This week's assignment was to create a train scheduler using JavaScript, JQuery and Google Firebase as a database. The user would be able to put in a custom train and 'track' its schedule. The schedule would update based on the real life current time using the Moment.JS library and storing the users' train times and 'routes' in Firebase.</p>

## CHALLENGES
* I had a lot of trouble using Moment.JS to calculate the next arrival times.
* The way the Moment.JS returned the data was difficult for me to use intuitively.
* I'll need to come back and revisit this assignment to polish it up and review my broken code.
