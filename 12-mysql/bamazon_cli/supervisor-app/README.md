# BAMAZON SUPERVISOR VERSION (EXTRA)

<p>Create a CLI for the 'supervisor'. Adds new commands for the user to select from.</p>

* VIEW PRODUCT SALES BY DEPARTMENT
* ADD NEW DEPARTMENT

<p>When the supervisor selects 'VIEW PRODUCT SALES BY DEPARTMENT', they will be shown a table of each distinct department along with the overhead costs (just a number I came up with), the product sales and the total profit.
The total profit is calculated by adding up the 'product sales' values of each item in the department and subtracting the overhead cost from it.
When the user select 'ADD NEW DEPARTMENT', they will be able to add a new distinct department row in the table. 

## CHALLENGES
* I wasn't able to get the second command finished due to time restraints.
* Handling the data so it passes and receives related values from the other table 'products'.
* Not replacing any values that don't need to be updated.
