# WEEK FIVE HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS

<p>This week's assignment was to build a timed, multiple choice trivia game using JavaScript. There were two options that I could have done. One being a timed quiz as a whole, or a quiz that shows only one question at a time and each one is timed. I started with the first option but later switched to the latter because the logic was easier to code and understand. The user would select their answer from one of three choices (radio buttons) and once submitted, would display the outcome. At the very end of the quiz there would be a results page that shows how many answers the user got right, wrong and the amount of questions left unanswered.</p>

## CHALLENGES
* As mentioned above, I was having trouble with the logic for the first option. I was unable to properly store the users answers for the quiz that displays all the questions at once. The issue I was having was that if the user had already selected an answer but decided to change it to a different one, or even choose the same one again, it would pass the value instead of replacing it. I could not figure out how to correct that behavior in the amount of time I had, so I went with the alternative quiz option.
